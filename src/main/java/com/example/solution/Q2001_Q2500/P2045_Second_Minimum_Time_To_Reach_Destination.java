public class P2045_Second_Minimum_Time_To_Reach_Destination {
    /**
     * Reference:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-05
     * 
     * Strategy:
     * 1. Create an adjacency list where adj[X] contains all the neighbors of node
     * X.
     * 2. Initialize two distance arrays dist1 and dist2 storing the minimum and the
     * second minimum distance from node 1 for all the nodes. We would initialize
     * these arrays with large integer values.
     * 3. Initialize a frequency array freq to store the number of times when a node
     * is popped out of the queue. Since we need the second minimal distance, each
     * node can be poped out at most twice.
     * 4. Initialize a priority queue storing a {distance, node_id} pair, ordered by
     * the distance. Insert node 1 with distance 0 into the queue as {0, 1}.
     * 5. Perform the Dijkstra until the priority queue is empty.
     * a. Pop out the top pair of integers, and fetch the node (let's say it is Y)
     * and distance to reach node Y.
     * b. Increase freq[Y] by 1.
     * c. If Y == n and freq[n] == 2, it means weâ€™ve encountered this node via the
     * second minimum distance. In this case, we return dist2[n].
     * d. Else, iterate over all the neighbors of Y.
     * e. For each neighbor, check if dist1[neighbor] could be updated using
     * distance[Y]. If not, check if dist2[neighbor] could be updated.
     * f. Push pair {distance_neighbor, neighbor} into the queue whenever
     * dist1[neighbor] or dist2[neighbor] is updated.
     * 6. If we do not return the answer after the queue is empty, we know that the
     * graph only has one node. Therefore, we just return 0.
