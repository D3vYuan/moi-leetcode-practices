     * Reference:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-05
     * 
     * Strategy:
     * 1. Main method numTeams:
     * a. Initialize:
     * a1. n as the length of rating.
     * a2. teams to store the total number of possible teams.
     * a3. two arrays increasingCache and decreasingCache of size n√ó4 to serve as
     * cache for the memoization.
     * b. Loop over the array rating. For each index startIndex:
     * b1. Call countIncreasingTeams and countDecreasingTeams with startIndex. Add
     * their results to teams.
     * c. Return teams.
     * 
     * 2. Helper method countIncreasingTeams:
     * a. Define a method countIncreasingTeams with parameters: rating,
     * currentIndex, teamSize and the cache increasingCache.
     * b. Initialize n as the length of rating.
     * c. If currentIndex is equal to n, return 0.
     * d. If teamSize is equal to 3, return 1.
     * e. If increasingCache already contains an entry with the current state,
     * return it.
     * f. Initialize a variable validTeams to 0.
     * g. Loop over all indices from currentIndex + 1 to the end of the array. For
     * each index nextIndex:
     * g1. If rating[nextIndex] is greater than rating[currentIndex], call
     * countIncreasingTeams with nextIndex and teamSize incremented by 1.
     * h. Cache validTeams with the current state in increasingCache and return it.
     * 
     * 3. Helper method countDecreasingTeams:
     * a. Define a method countDecreasingTeams with parameters: rating,
     * currentIndex, teamSize and the cache decreasingCache.
     * b. This method is exactly the same as countIncreasingTeams except for majorly
     * one thing:
     * b1. We check whether rating[nextIndex] is less than rating[currentIndex] to
     * call countDecreasingTeams.
