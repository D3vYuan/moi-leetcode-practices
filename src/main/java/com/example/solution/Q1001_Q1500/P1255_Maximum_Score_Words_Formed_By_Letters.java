     * Reference:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-words-formed-by-letters/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-05-05
     * 
     * Strategy:
     * 1. Generate a frequency array where freq[c] is the number of times letter c
     * appears in letters.
     * 2. Initialize maxScore to store the largest score among valid subsets.
     * 3. Call a recursive subroutine check that passes w (the index of the current
     * word), words, score, subsetLetters, and totalScore (the sum of word scores in
     * the subset) as parameters. Steps 4-10 describe the check method.
     * 4. If w equals âˆ’1, all words have been considered, and we should update
     * maxScore to totalScore if maxScore is less than totalScore.
     * 5. Otherwise, we need to consider two possible recursive calls: one that adds
     * words[w] to the subset, and one that doesn't.
     * 6. To account for not adding a word, call check(w - 1, words, score,
     * subsetLetters, totalScore).
     * 7. To add words[w] to the subset, update subsetLetters and totalScore to
     * include the word.
     * 8. If the addition of words[w] does not violate letter limits imposed by
     * freq, make the recursive call check(w - 1, words, score, subsetLetters,
     * totalScore). To check for validity, we define the isValidWord method as
     * follows:
     * a. For each character in the alphabet, check if freq[c] < subsetLetters[c].
     * If there exists such c, return false.
     * b. Return true if the subset can be built out of the given letters.
     * 9. Roll back the changes to subsetLetters and totalScore immediately after
     * making this recursive call.
     * 10. Call check(W - 1, words, score, subsetLetters, 0), where subsetLetters is
     * initially all zeros.
     * 11. Return maxScore as the result.
