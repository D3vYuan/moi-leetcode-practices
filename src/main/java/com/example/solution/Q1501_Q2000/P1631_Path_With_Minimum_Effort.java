     * Reference:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-19
     * 
     * Strategy:
     * 1. We use a differenceMatrix of size rowâ‹…col where each cell represents the
     * minimum effort required to reach that cell from all the possible paths.
     * Also, initialize we all the cells in the differenceMatrix to infinity
     * (MAX_INT) since none of the cells are reachable initially.
     * 2. As we start visiting each cell, all the adjacent cells are now reachable.
     * We update the absolute difference between the current cell and adjacent cells
     * in the differenceMatrix. At the same time, we also push all the adjacent
     * cells in a priority queue. The priority queue holds all the reachable cells
     * sorted by its value in differenceMatrix, i.e the cell with minimum absolute
     * difference with its adjacent cells would be at the top of the queue.
     * 3. We begin by adding the source cell (x=0, y=0) in the queue. Now, until we
     * have visited the destination cell or the queue is not empty, we visit each
     * cell in the queue sorted in the order of priority. The less is the difference
     * value(absolute difference with adjacent cell) of a cell, the higher is its
     * priority.
     * a. Get the cell from the top of the queue curr and visit the current cell.
     * b. For each of the 4 cells adjacent to the current cell, calculate the
     * maxDifference which is the maximum absolute difference to reach the adjacent
     * cell (adjacentX, adjacentY) from current cell (curr.x, curr.y).
     * 4. At the end, the value at differenceMatrix[row - 1][col - 1] is the minimum
     * effort required to reach the destination cell (row-1,col-1).
