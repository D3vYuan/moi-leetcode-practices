     * Reference:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-to-connect-all-points/editorial/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-01-19
     * 
     * Explanation:
     * 1. The union-find data structure has two primary functions:
     * a. find(a): Function which returns the ID of the group in which node a
     * belongs.
     * b. union(a,b): Function to merge the groups of node a and b. If they already
     * belong to the same group, we don't do anything and return false to signify
     * the edge between a and b was not added. Otherwise, we return true.
     * 
     * Strategy:
     * 1. Create a class UnionFind:
     * a. group, rank - Arrays to store the group (also known as root) and rank of
     * each node.
     * b. find(a) - Function to find the group of node aaa using path compression.
     * c. union(a,b) - Function to merge groups of nodes a and b by rank.
     * 2. Initialize some variables:
     * a. n - Number of nodes in the graph.
     * b. mstCost - Cost to build the MST.
     * c. edgesUsed - Number of edges included in the MST.
     * d. uf - UnionFind object of size nnn to connect nnn nodes.
     * e. allEdges - Array to store all the edges of our graph.
     * 3. Iterate over all coordinate points, and for each coordinate point, create
     * an edge to all other coordinate points. Store the edges in the allEdges
     * array. Each element of allEdges contains three values: edge weight, node1,
     * node2.
     * 4. Sort the elements in allEdge in increasing order of their edge weights.
     * 5. Iterate over each edge in allEdges until edgesUsed becomes equal to nâˆ’1.
     * For each edge:
     * a. Try joining both the nodes of the current edge.
     * b. If the nodes are already connected, we discard the current edge because
     * including this edge would create a cycle. Otherwise, we add the weight of the
     * current edge to the mstCost variable and increment edgesUsed by 1.
     * 6. Return the total cost of MST, mstCost.
